# DatasetðŸš€

Our model is trained separately on three datasets. You can download and organize these datasets in the following structure:

* [EarthReason](https://huggingface.co/datasets/earth-insights/EarthReason)
* [RRSIS-D](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xqi3Am2Vgm4a5tHqiV9tfaqKNovcuK3A)
* [RefSegRS](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JessicaYuan/RefSegRS)

# Pretrained WeightsðŸ“‚

You can download the pre-trained weights of [Phi-1.5](https://example.com/phi) and [Mask2Former](https://example.com/mask2former) from these links, and place them in the `pre_trained` folder according to the following structure:

```
